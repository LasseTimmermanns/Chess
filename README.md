This is a simple implementation of a chess game using Java Swing for the GUI and basic data structures for game logic. The project includes the following components:
- GUI: A chess board with pieces and a side menu for game options.
- Data Structures: Classes for handling game data such as positions, moves, and piece information.
- Movement Generators: Classes for generating possible moves for each piece type.
- Listeners: Classes for handling user input and game events.
